> A JAMstack blog with carefully considered architecture.

2019/12/05: This repo will hold the contents of my blog&mdash;possibly the longest running project I have. With over 300,000 words written over the course of 6 years... well, it's a pity that I don't currently have a presence online. I'm rebuilding my wordpress blog from scratch using some of the beautiful technologies that have matured recently 

## Architecture

Admittedly, this may seem like overkill for a simple blog, but there were a lot of a lot of requirements I find necessary to build something that I could use comfortably for the rest of my lifetime. (yes, yes, I understand how technical debt works)
