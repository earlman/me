## Fields

These fields should be available in *all* Collections. Though the exact usage may vary between Collections, the format must be consistent.

* `date-modified`
* `collection`
* `creator`

#### **`title`**
Indentifier of the contained content

Type: `string`

**Do not** prefix titles to show that an article is part of a group. 

    Example: 
    ðŸš« title: "Book Review - The Stormlight Archives are my new favorite fantasy series"
    âœ… title: "The Stormlight Archives are my new favorite fantasy series"


#### **`date-published`**

Type: `string`

#### **`creator`**

### Recommended Fields
